The average office space in the United States strives towards silence. In the office, music is not a communal experience. It is individually accessed through headphones—sometimes clandestinely via a single earbud—to prevent disturbing one’s coworker in the adjacent cubicle or down the hall. The song playing is a private, often secret, soundtrack to data entry and grant proposals, emails back to one’s boss and surfing the web on company time. The office soundtrack is usually unspoken, hidden in the shadows of business as usual."

As early as seven years old I was robbed of sleep by fears that Katia, whom I thought to be the girl I was destined to marry, hated me. At ten, my qualms turned from romantic to the mystical-academic: I feared that when I awoke all my knowledge of multiplication and division would be erased from my brain and, as a result, I’d be held back a year. Then, in early adolescence, my father lost his job at the ad agency and, although my mother herself had a good job, I was afraid we’d end up in a homeless shelter where I would inevitably be sexually assaulted. (Over dinner one night, my parents and I had watched a long news piece about the epidemic of sexual crimes in homeless shelters.)"

There was a sign in front of a dense section of woods that said, “Welcome to the Croatan National Forest,” but there was no way for us to get inside the forest. There were narrow dirt roads with chains across them. There were lone generators imprisoned in chain link fences. We drove until we found a gas station. We asked for directions.

An ethical dilemma constrains my movement and engulfs me in inaction. When I first entered the bathroom, the toilet seat was already up (making it convenient for me, as I only needed to pee), but since this is an all-inclusive bathroom, with the worldwide data suggesting that there is a little over 50% chance that the next user of the bathroom will be someone who sits to urinate, I don’t know if I should leave the toilet seat as is. If this were a bathroom marked “penis only,” I would not even consider putting the seat down as the rate of public-standing-penis-having-pissers significantly outweighs the number of public-sitting-penis-having-pissers and public-sitting-penis-having-poopers, by a wide margin. However, this is one of those shared, one seater restrooms, that’s all inclusive along the gender spectrum, which, as resident of North Carolina—the state of the bathroom bill fiasco—is definitely a good thing on the macro level, but on a micro level raises more questions like this one."

When Diane came to my house, her eyes curiously followed the patterns of the ceiling cracks and rusty soviet radiators with my grandpa’s socks on it. I could read the bewilderment on her face and a silent question of why my carpets were hung on the wall above the couch.

Sometimes I'm so far away I don't believe she is even real until I reach a hand out in the night to touch her, pushing through the veil of distance between us, letting my palm cup the round pajama-covered curves of her bottom.

The days usually wrapped around 5:30 p.m., 8:30 p.m. back at home, the time I’d be getting into my pajamas and watching TV with my husband. My body likes routines. My body isn’t happy now. My neck stiff, I sit up and stretch my arms. At least my not acclimating to the time change is paying off now with my early flight. \n\

…….I snap on the bedside lamp. The hotel room isn’t bad, but it isn’t superb either. The carpet and curtains are a matching drab gray. The upholstery on the armchair, also in a shade of gray, needs a deep cleaning. The desk and dresser have the usual signs of wear—scratches, dings, and watermarks. The shower is nice, though. I adjust the water temperature. The white subway-tiled floor and walls of the shower are clean. The showerhead is massive and produces a high-pressure rainfall that I know I can lose time under, so I focus on the tasks at hand—wash and rinse, and rinse a little more. "

He never claimed to be innocent, even when he was. He feels like he’s guilty of everything. He never eats salad or vegetables. He lives on Diet Coke and gas station food.

The first floor is where the creatives conceptualize, write, illustrate, and film ads.

Ads that sell products die a quick death. Ads that expose their products’ souls are refined, elevated, polished to a blinding sheen, and unleashed upon the world, where they reveal deep truths, transform the global conversation, and so on. \n\
 \n\
Really, nothing distinguishes the first floor from the offices of any generic advertising firm. Similar work has been done better and worse. Occasionally, the corporation’s street team devises pranks that go viral. More often, adblockers consign their five-second videos to oblivion."

 \n\
They remember teletype machines and Christmas parties with booze, held right here in the office, with the director’s blessing. One year, the office held a slave auction to raise money for charity. It was all in good fun. The slaves had to do things like take their new masters shopping for cute clothes, or make them coffee in the morning. \n\
 \n\
They judge celebrity diets, political policy, the barista's new hairstyle. They judge strangers and friends. Only their own children are off limits. One sometimes talks about the other’s children but whispered, behind a hand. The office ladies observe their own rules."

The tattoo on his shoulder is of a scorpion with a can of Coors in one of its pincers. Everyone is pushing forward, but there is no forward. Security guards in blue shirts lift girls in hemp halter-tops over the rail. Their faces are red, their limbs floppy and useless. I’m so thirsty I consider licking the sweat off the back of the scorpion man. Alice in Chains hasn’t even taken the stage yet. Everything smells like marijuana. Joe can’t take it. He climbs onto the shoulders of the guy in front of him, is immediately flung into the air. He extends his arms. For a few seconds he is Christ floating on a river of hands. They deposit him to the security guards, who give him bottled water and send him to the First Aid tent. I think one of my ribs is broken."

KKUURRTT is a writer with few accomplishments worth mentioning. \n\
 \n\
KKUURRTT has been published here and there, but do you really even care where? Like does it actually matter or is this just the game we’re supposed to play to make it in the literary industry. If I don’t participate in the game am I relieving myself of the tension, or just exacerbating the whole situation? Is this bio in fact a bio? And that, in and of itself, makes things much worse?"

But I know that he is lying because I have read The Great Gatsby before, and I have read David’s stories too. \n\
 \n\
He is lying because F. Scott Fitzgerald was the drowned millionaire and the Midwestern kid who got away, and he was every word he ever put on a page. Everyone knows this. He was Daisy too, even though Daisy was also Zelda. He was the Jazz Age that he wrote about; he was every party, every flute of champagne, every wrecked car."

We watched as our mothers and fathers pulled money from here and there — the uncle who put all his money in stocks before 2007, the grandmother who went immediately to her mahogany dresser and produced a stack of weathered bills."

That morning he was running because he was late for school. When he did eventually stand outside the door of his classroom, he couldn’t breathe fast enough. There was sweat dripping from his face and his white shirt was soaked in patches— armpits, chest and back, they looked like islands on a sea of white. He shut his eyes when he heard the teacher’s voice behind the door. He had been praying that she would not be there when he arrived. "

Forty-three years of marriage had granted Professor Mrs. Emem Ubong some reprieve from this daily ritual, allowing instead for an extra hour of sleep; or more accurately, semi-conscious drowsing. Being a light sleeper, she could hardly sleep through the shrill ringing of the alarm clock, the low rumbling that was all she heard of her husband’s prayers, or the shuffling, banging and splashing that accompanied his morning toilet. On a good day he would even hum to himself. "

This is an undisputed miracle. For all of us alive now, however, with our ready access consumer stereos, recorded music, and live entertainment extravaganzas, the miracle of song has become old hat.

Elsewhere, the two literary novels everyone should read were discovered to be not so good. People had bought them and read fifty pages and thought, Oh, well, back to the internet. Yet many of the critics agreed they were both brilliant, assured, and certainly the best work the authors had produced in years, though one of them had only that book to their credit.

Whenever we share a meal with them he eats a lot of bread and butter, drinks a lot of wine, sweat forming on his forehead and upper lip, and seldom fails to mention that he takes runs on the beach and does sit-ups and push-ups at the end of his run. As we drive home after dinner, Vanessa and I often express fear that Steve is going to run himself into a heart attack. Vanessa is a kinder person than I am, and she doesn't make smart remarks about what Steve would look like doing sit-ups and push-ups. I'm the one who does that.

 \n\
My sister wasn’t interested in football, anyway, so it was no loss for her not to watch it on TV. But I understood the game and found it exciting. I liked seeing the attacking players move the ball forward, yard by yard.  \n\
I appreciated acrobatic tackles, where the ball carrier would be upended in a no-hands cartwheel in the air."

In particular I liked her Instagram Stories, every pic warm and expensive. I would lie in my hand-me-down sheets on Saturday mornings and tap, tap, tap through them until I heard the rolling boil of the kettle in the shared kitchen. \n\
 \n\
She wrote about food, but not the food I ate. She wrote long, sprawling essays that conjured smells, memories, and phrases to be savoured. Her prose simmered, her incantations of antique and unfamiliar words an ancient English too refined for me. I envied her freedom: when I wrote like that it usually came back soggy and raw in the middle, dry or burned at the edges. She had flair. She had taste. "

I was out working on it just now, but my fingers went numb from cold and I couldn’t tie the knots. I came in to warm my hands, but felt the urge to write you. I suppose I can’t stop wondering. The question of you takes up more room in my mind than scripture, though that will come as no surprise to you. I can’t pretend I was ever the holiest of women.

The “endless crossings” invoke arrivals and departures. Comings and goings. Encounters and re-encounters with different platforms of foreign and domestic power.

You no longer feel the need to speak to anyone out loud, for there is no one to speak to, and you no longer speak to yourself, for there is nothing to say. All is left silent and – unutuyorsun – you forget why anyone uttered words to begin with."

If I yet display vibrancy on this occasion, flash and metallic sheen, I can say the interjection of timidity at a school of fish is an aspect of life, that however brief, does no justice to the nature of authentic experience. A moment of my timidity doesn’t allude to an entire demeanor. Boldness is neither discredited nor wholly lost forever, as I connate a resonance with the schools of fish— they seem caught in a natural oblivion. Another’s fabricated filter might be lost on this opportunity for connection, such that the fish are wily and as playful as the dolphin, when in fact they are rather not, and seem oblivious, darting around limbs as if a natural function of their instinctive travels. The sea felt marvelous anyway."

As the rice simmered, Yet and I sat on the rungs of the steep entry stairs and stoked the fire while we clapped our hands and sang. I left the rice on the fire for a long time, to be sure it was well done, then ran home and presented it to my mother — “Mae,” as I called her in Khmer."

You clean your apartment, you take out all the trash that’s been accumulating because normally you can’t bend in half to pick up the trash bag and walk it to the apartment garbage room. You collapse the recycling with vigor and revel in the smell of card box and Amazon tape, feeling some guilt for Prime-ing your groceries all week. But really, you spent all of the previous day lying in bed with an itchy ass crack since your spine wouldn’t allow you to reach around and wipe sufficiently, so how could you even get up to get groceries, guilt be damned."

A derivative narrative formed in her head, a historical novel about the Tonton Macoutes, President “Papa Doc” Duvalier’s secret police force. She didn’t want to write about the Chicago suburbs because she wanted to disassociate herself from them. She avoided telling people that she was from the North Shore or, if she did, she foregrounded that her mother worked multiple jobs in food service and that her father delivered pizzas and that she’d received full scholarships to every school she’d attended. Her advantages in life felt embarrassing because she knew, on some level, that she hadn’t earned them, and because she seemed unable to function as well as such a fortunate person should. She didn’t want to write about her father because dwelling there made her sick; she mostly pretended he didn’t exist. Asking herself why she’d never been south of the Chicago loop other than when her father took her on voyeuristic car rides through Black neighborhoods as a child felt too uncomfortable, so she shut these questions down as well. Her friends freshman year were almost all international students."

I am well familiar with the intention of the substance.

 \n\
It’s the question that constantly lingers. Through all the heartache and exploring, I always circle back to why I was never enough for these men who came and went as if they were just passing by. \n\
 \n\
Growing up, I was constantly made aware of how “perfect” my figure was; it distorted my own self-image. I thought it was the only thing of note about myself. It became so internalized that I believed I was worthless without my body. \n\
 \n\
That the only way to fall in love was through capturing a man’s attention with my body. I weaponized it. I thought there was power in owning myself, in being free and sexual, and I was right to an extent. I learned so much about myself, my body, and my likes and dislikes, but the intention was never right."

When you’re sober, you’re the perfect man. You’re everything I ever wanted. Nine out of ten times you’ve been drunk, you’ve been completely fine. But that night was odd. \n\
 \n\
I’ve been embarrassingly drunk before; I’m not judging you for that. But the person you became that night was different. And what’s weird is moments before, you made me the happiest I’d ever been. \n\
 \n\
At ****’s house, you were sweet, thoughtful, romantic. You didn’t switch up until the party got relocated, and we moved on to the next house. And it wasn’t just me who saw it. You weren’t aware, or maybe you were, but you received a lot of looks of concern that night."

 \n\
When she woke to the sun in the window above her desk, she also felt teeth circled around her pale wrists and ankles like manacles. It wasn’t painful—more like the affectionate gnawing of a cat seeking companionship—though Nomi peeled back her sheets sticky with that week’s heatwave to display pinkish indents lined up on her skin, matching the teeth of an unnamed jaw. \n\
 \n\
Nomi dragged herself to the mirror, where she slapped her cheeks and pinched her eyelids until her face brightened. She rubbed ointment on her wrists and ankles, softening the marks. The house was just lonely, she told herself, though that was its own fault, and Nomi would never fully forgive it for swallowing her parents."

He pours drinks, makes introductions to the girls who will dance for a Nickel—and you get to call the tune! They ping the sound system from their phones, which they wear like knuckledusters, an infinite playlist some johns pore through like it’s a menu of sex acts they’re pricing à la carte. \n\
 \n\
Intently holding milady’s hand, a jewelthief kissing rings, they come away all sparkly smiles as some rusted Tin Machine-era Bowie, or late period K-pop peels the paint off the cinderblock walls and they finally dance—like string puppets—or wallow, like bears."

        "text": "You’re sitting on the edge of an afternoon with her, and you’re thinking in stoppages. At the precipice, she’s scuffing the backs of her shoes against the rock below, and you think that it must not hurt nearly enough. Her boots against sediment, digging in. You kick off your sneakers and watch them dive into nothing below, and think, now is not the time for regrets. The balls of your feet pushing into the stone, bone on stone. \n\
 \n\
You imagine that you’re sitting on the edge of your words instead. \n\
 \n\
In the terrible silence there, you grapple for something to do before you remember your feet still rubbing against the rocks. Carefully, you bend over and untwist the part holding your ankle, bringing it back up for inspection. It’s red, and when you gasp, she looks at you, finally."

Fuck. I suck on my palm, edges of a gash pricking frost-bitten lips as I prop my elbows on shattered knees. My jeans are a Jackson Pollock painting, spattered with crimson and ash gray, except instead of paint, gravel tincture-blood drizzles down my pant leg. \n\

“You okay, Aud?” Mariam calls out, gliding towards me, flashlight taped to the plywood underbelly of her longboard."
